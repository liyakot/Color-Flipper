### Description
___
The essence of the game is to switch the background color using a button. There are also buttons in the navbar that switch the color format: **rgb** or **hex**

I took the idea and design from the video from *freeСodeСamp*, but the logic of the project is completely mine. If anyone is interested, here is a link to the <a href="https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4">video</a> (there are a lot of cool projects :fire:)

The game is created with native JS and CSS, without any frameworks and libraries.

### How it works
___

Using js, I generate all possible color options. For example, a function to create a hex color:
